THE SONS RECEIVE AUTHORITY TO RULE

THEN they arrived before the face of the lord, whose name was Nacxit. He was the only judge over a great dominion. He then gave to them the signs and symbols of their lordship. Thus they received the signs of office for the Ah Pop, and the Ah Pop of the Reception House. They received the signs of their glory and lordship that pertained to the offices of Ah Pop and Ah Pop of the Reception House. These, then, are the names of the tokens of their glory and lordship:

Canopy and throne,
Bone flute and drum,
Shining Black Powder and Yellow Stone,
Puma Paws and Jaguar Paws,
Head and Hooves of the Deer,
Arm Band and Snailshell Rattle,
Tobacco Gourd and Food Bowl,
Macaw Feathers and Snowy Egret Feathers.

All these they brought when they returned. They also brought the writings of Tulan from the other side of the sea. These were the writings, as they were called, that contained the many things with which they had been invested.
